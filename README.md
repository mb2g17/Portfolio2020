# Matthew Barnes Portfolio (2020)

My portfolio made in TypeScript with Nuxt.js.

## Continuous Deployment
Pushing commits to the master branch automatically deploys the site to the production heroku app.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work with Nuxt.js, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
